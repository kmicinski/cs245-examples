# Examples for CS245--Spring 2019

These are the examples for CS245 in Spring 2019 at Haverford
College. Unless otherwise specified, this code was written by Kris
Micinski (krismicinski@gmail.com).

Compile with (e.g.,)

    clang++ hello.cpp -o output

Which produces an output executable `output` (you can of course change this)

You can then run it with:

    ./output
